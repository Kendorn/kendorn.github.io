Hello, my name is Ken. 
I go to the University at Buffalo and I work at a library. 
My major is Biochemisty and I am loking ot become a chemist.
 After I find a job, I want to save up money to open an icecream shop and a dog shelter. Lastly, my final goal is to find cures to illnesses and find new ways to heal people.
